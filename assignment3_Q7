		 Question-7

		Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending machine. 
		An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, 
		in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), 
		and the machine accepts only a single dollar bill to pay for the item.

      	Sample output

      	Price in cents : 95

      	Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickles

		int nickles=(change-quarters*25-dimes*10)/5;
		System.out.println("You change is " + quarters + " quarters, " + dimes + " dimes, and " + nickles + " nickles" );
